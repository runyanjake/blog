See my cooking content on my cooking [website](https://recipes.whitney.rip).

Cooking websites have always been some of the worst websites in my opinion. Plagued with ads, popups, and other internet detritus, sites like these make a simple fact finding mission into a maze of scrolling and clicks.

I wanted to create a site that I could personally refer to when cooking something whose recipe I didn't have committed to memory yet. Here, readability and the ability to flip between ingredients and recipe steps are very important.

I implemented this website using Meta's [Docusaurus documentation framework](https://docusaurus.io) to allow for content driven development using the blog template. This served as the jumping point for me to get interested with content forward web design.
