In my day to day work it is difficult to find a quality artistic outlet. During college, my roommates got into film photography, and I was inspired by their photos of us, our friends, and Santa Cruz landscapes. I later created a small form factor build of a Sony Alpha Î±6300 which I have been using to take my own photos of nature, friends, and sights from our bike rides.

I am inspired by the beauty of nature, and any view that makes subjects fall into line for my brain.
