# blog
Some blog posts, in markdown. Source of truth for the blogs on my various websites/portfolios.

Viewable on Github in the UI, but best viewed in a IDE with markdown preview plugin.

## Format
Standard markdown format, with yaml front matter header for metadata. In Github markdown that renders as a table, which is fine.
